## Solution to "Cannot find module 'jsonwebtoken'" Error

This error occurs in the backend application because the required Node.js modules are not installed. The `jsonwebtoken` package is correctly listed in your package.json dependencies, but the actual module files need to be installed.

### Steps to Resolve

1. First, ensure you're in the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

If the above doesn't work, try these additional steps:

3. Remove existing node_modules and package-lock.json:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

4. Clear npm cache:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

5. Reinstall dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

6. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Verification
After installing the dependencies, verify that the node_modules folder exists in your backend directory and contains the jsonwebtoken package:
```bash
ls node_modules/jsonwebtoken
```

If you continue experiencing issues, check that:
1. You have a stable internet connection
2. Your npm registry is accessible
3. You have sufficient permissions in the directory
4. Your Node.js version is compatible (the project uses jsonwebtoken ^9.0.0)
